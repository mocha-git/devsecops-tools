# main.tf
# 
# This file can be empty if all resources are defined in other .tf files.
# In a more modular setup, you might import modules here, for example:
#
# module "serverless_arch" {
#   source       = "./."
#   project_name = "my-project"
#   ...
# }
#
# Since everything else is separated, we can keep this file minimal.
